# Estimate-Pi
# Using python and numpy to estimate pi value
The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an infinite series that can be used to
generate a numerical approximation. This assignment has function called "estimate_pi" that uses this formula to compute and return an estimate of
π. It should use a while loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is smaller than 1e-15 (which is Python notation for 10^−15)
